# powerbi-guided-dashboard-project

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard built as a guided implementation following Alex The Analyst’s Power BI tutorial series on YouTube.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency with Power BI tools and workflows rather than to present a fully original business case.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query
- Data modeling and relationship management
- DAX measures for KPIs and summary metrics
- Interactive dashboards with slicers, filters, and drilldowns
- Dashboard layout and visual design for stakeholder-style reporting

## What I Did
- Recreated the dashboard from scratch in Power BI Desktop
- Validated measures and visuals for correctness
- Refined formatting, labels, and layout for clarity
- Exported report views for documentation and sharing
