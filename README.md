# powerbi-guided-dashboard-project

This repository contains an interactive Power BI report developed as a guided build while following Alex The Analyst’s Power BI tutorial series. The project emphasizes business intelligence workflows, interactivity, and dashboard design rather than static analysis.

## The Project 
This project was built to practice:
- transforming raw data into a reusable data model
- defining metrics that respond dynamically to filters
- designing reports that invite exploration

## Inside the Report
The Power BI file includes:
- A cleaned and transformed dataset prepared in Power Query
- A structured data model with defined relationships
- DAX measures powering KPIs and summary metrics
- Interactive visuals with slicers, cross-filtering, and drilldowns
- A dashboard layout optimized for clarity and stakeholder consumption
